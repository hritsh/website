		Hello! I'm Hritish & I like building stuff at the intersection of <b>fullstack development</b>, <b>machine learning</b>, & <b
			>health tech</b
		>.
	</p>

	<div class="separator"></div>
	<p>
		I'm currently working at <b><a href="https://www.circummedtechpharma.com" target="_blank">Circum Medtech</a></b> as a Machine Learning
		Engineer, where I'm building a smart catheter & patch system that uses Machine Learning to detect sepsis early in ICU patients.
	</p>
	<p>
		My work involves pre-processing & training models on large healthcare datasets, developing real-time data pipelines with ICU
		systems, and building clinician-facing apps for monitoring patient vitals.
	</p>

	<p>
		Outside of work I'm either ricing my desktop into a war crime, spending hours writing scripts that solve problems I invented,
		lowballing thinkpad & ipod listings, or trial-dating new frameworks I'll abandon in two weeks.
