		Hello! I'm Hritish & I like building stuff at the intersection of <b>software engineering</b>, <b>machine learning</b>, & <b
			>healthcare</b
		>. I'm obsessed with learning across the whole stack and turning that curiosity into things people actually use.

		I'm currently working at <b><a href="https://www.circummedtechpharma.com" target="_blank">Circum Medtech</a></b> as a Machine Learning
		Engineer, where I'm working on a smart catheter system that uses ML to detect sepsis early in ICU patients.
	</p>
	<p>
		My work involves training models on large healthcare datasets, developing real-time data pipelines with ICU systems, and
		building clinician-facing apps for monitoring patient vitals.

		Outside of work I'm ricing my desktop into a war crime, writing scripts that solve problems I invented, lowballing thinkpad
		listings like it's a sport, and trial-dating new frameworks I'll abandon in two weeks.
